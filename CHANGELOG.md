# Changelog

## v0.3.1
Sorry that this update took so long. I'm involved in quite a few projects and didn't have the time to work on this mod. The next thing on my todo list is implementing GroovyScript support, which may be a bit difficult as the mod uses the IC2 way of registering recipes. So whenever IC2/VGT gets proper GroovyScript support, it _should_ automatically work for this mod as well."

- updated to the newest version of IC2C for 1.12.2 to fix the memory leak

- added config options to disable the registration of the default recipes
